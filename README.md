Many of the PyData open-source projects are developed and led by volunteers worldwide. As a maintainer of scikit-learn and a contributor to these projects, we aim to welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experiences. In this talk, we explore why you may want to contribute, how to contribute, and what to expect when contributing. You can be motivated to work on open-source projects for many reasons, and they are all valid as long as you are respectful and collaborative. Contributions come in many forms, such as documentation fixes, answering user questions, debugging issues, creating bug reports, and reviewing pull requests. The skills you pick up while contributing to one open-source project are easily transferable to other projects. Lastly, we learn what to expect when working in a collaborative open-source development environment.
